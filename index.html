            <p>In my adult working career, it has always been important to me that I have worked in organisations that have a positive impact on society.<span id="pastDots">..</span><span id="pastMore">
            
            <br><br>I have always wanted to use my skills to help others. With that in mind, after I graduated university with a degree in IT for Business, I worked in the public sector, specifically the NHS, in various roles understanding how to work with people and how complex organisations work.

            <br><br>This inspired me to learn counselling skills via part-time courses for 2 years, while working full time. This helped develop my empathy and listening skills which have helped me in my personal and professional life to this current day.

            <br><br>
            In around 2015, I started to get interested in web development and the ways in which apps/tools could be built to allow efficiency in businesses. I spent some time doing a few introduction courses inlcuding codeacademy.

            <br><br>In 2016, I became a student of <a href="http://thefirehoseproject.com/" target="_blank">The Firehose Project</a>, an online 16-week full-stack web development bootcamp course. I learnt how to build apps using HTML/CSS and Ruby on Rails, and how to work in a team of developers.
            
            <br><br>To learn more about what I learnt on the course, please find links to <a href="https://helearnstocode.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">my study blog</a> and my published <a href="https://realworldcoding.io/the-most-important-lessons-i-learned-during-my-2nd-month-of-coding-58ab4367d87c" target="_blank">medium article</a>, here or above in the navigation.
            
            <br><br>I really enjoyed this experience and want to continue my coding journey to become a web developer.</span></p>

            <p>I am taking action to undergo a career transition. Currently I work as IT project support for a public sector organisation in<span id="presentDots">...</span><span id="presentMore"> London and am in the process of transitioning to Web Development.
            
            <br><br>In terms of my coding journey, I am working through the freecodecamp cirriculum, completing the Founders and Coders pre-requistes, going to tech meetups weekly and always learning via tech blogs and youtube channels.
            
            <br><br>When I'm not working on my career goals, I enjoy being active (via calisthenics and swimming), working on my personal development, volunteering for <a href="https://animalequality.org.uk/" target="_blank">an animal welfare charity</a>, music, <a href="https://gph.is/1AP1AEq" target="_blank">pomoderos</a> and being a student of audiobooks.

            <p>I am applying for the programme because<span id="futureDots">...</span><span id="futureMore"> I want to become a web developer and bring my current skillset to work on teams building a product and adding value to a wide number of people's lives.

            <br><br>
            There has been so many situations in my working life, where I wished I had more tech skills to provide solutions to a problem. I believe becoming a web developer would allow me to do that 

            <br><br>
            Always have tried to work in environment that help society, NHS, to Gov. Spare time, volunteer for animal charities and when I was more involved in music, playing music I put on several benefit gigs for anti-war/war casualty charities. Unfortunately from my experience of DIY change, all the way to working in bigger organisations, I have found I have felt a bigger impact of change working in smaller organisations. Big-cog in machine, less creativity, which I believe made the smaller projects more effective and impactful. I want to allow my creativity tom be more part of my life aligned with my bigger purpose and vision.

            GIVE BACK
            <br><br>
            

            <br><br>
            
            I enjoy problem solving and adding value for

            ORGANISATIONS. PRINCE2 and ITIL cert. Flexible problem solver, natural planner, working with others,

            My goal is to become a fully fledged working developer so that I can provide more value to organisations.

            I am focussed and ready for the challenge!</span></p>
